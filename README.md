This is the Spatial template you can see in Canvas and I made some improvements.

Added 7 prefabs in 7 different colors material and it is 8 in total. You can find it in Assets -> Examples -> Avatar_Spatian.
Also made couple of visual scripts(Assets -> Examples -> Avatar_Spatian -> Scripts)

## How to use:
1. Create an empty object in the scene.
2. Drag one prefab into the object.
3. Create -> Spatial -> Interactable, create an interactable object in the object you created in step 1.
4. Open Portal (top-right),
